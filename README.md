## Coding Logs

### Day 1

- Following tutorials from [30 Days Of React](https://github.com/fullstackreact/30-days-of-react) and following the exercises for Notification panel. Had a hard time in getting the CSS for the view but I changed my mind to use [w3-css](https://github.com/fullstackreact/30-days-of-react) stylesheet.

- I found the instructions for the `<Timeline />` component is too large so I broke it up into a 3 different *React Component*

- Had a clear understanding of basic React `props` and implemented it on the components. As you can see on the following commits:
    * [{this.props.time}](https://github.com/KBPsystem777/30-Days-Of-React/commit/1bcd3247e9d26b525945d733c81ccc8a73948043#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR17)

    * [Output](https://github.com/KBPsystem777/30-Days-Of-React/commit/1bcd3247e9d26b525945d733c81ccc8a73948043#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR48)


### Day 2

- Still studying how to display data in React using the JSON via props.

- I did this method using the `map()` function in JavaScript. Challenge right now is the manipulation of array objects - I need to dig hard on `objects`


### Day 3

- Just watched some YouTub videos today discussing `props` in order to have deeper understanding of it. Here are my personal recommendations:

    * [Passing Data with Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIU8ekYndKw&index=2&list=PLdVadnqHPMJEY8Dz4DdHAqrounEZJ0x6M&t=0s)
