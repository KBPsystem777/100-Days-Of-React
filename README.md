## Coding Logs

### Day 1

- Following tutorials from [30 Days Of React](https://github.com/fullstackreact/30-days-of-react) and following the exercises for Notification panel. Had a hard time in getting the CSS for the view but I changed my mind to use [w3-css](https://github.com/fullstackreact/30-days-of-react) stylesheet.

- I found the instructions for the `<Timeline />` component is too large so I broke it up into a 3 different *React Component*

- Had a clear understanding of basic React `props` and implemented it on the components. As you can see on the following commits:
    * [{this.props.time}](https://github.com/KBPsystem777/30-Days-Of-React/commit/1bcd3247e9d26b525945d733c81ccc8a73948043#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR17)

    * [Output](https://github.com/KBPsystem777/30-Days-Of-React/commit/1bcd3247e9d26b525945d733c81ccc8a73948043#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR48)
