## Coding Logs

### Day 1

- Following tutorials from [30 Days Of React](https://github.com/fullstackreact/30-days-of-react) and following the exercises for Notification panel. Had a hard time in getting the CSS for the view but I changed my mind to use [w3-css](https://github.com/fullstackreact/30-days-of-react) stylesheet.
